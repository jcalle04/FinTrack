## Features (Written as stories)
*For this stories, I will be meassuring the priority from 1 to 5, while the estimate will represent the ammount of work the feature represents, from 1 to 5.*

- **As an user, I want to have a portfolio, so that I can track my stock/crypto.**
  - Priority: 5 -> *It is the main purpose of the app.*
  - Estimate: 5 -> *Taking into account that everything else departs from having a portfolio.*
  
- **As an user, I want to be notifyed when there is a big movement in my portfolio, so that I can operate in consecuence.**
  - Priority: 3 -> *It is neccessary, but not the first thing to take into consideration*
  - Estimate: 3 -> *Not that hard once we have the portfilio and tracker API^*

- **As an user, I want to set up alerts, so that I do not have to be looking into my active eternaly**
  - Priority: 3 -> *Same as with the last one*
  - Estimate: 2 -> *If everything untill this point is working, It will not be hard to implement*
